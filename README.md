# Open Music Theory OER


This is a fork of Kris Shaffer, Bryn Hughes, and Brian Moseley, [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com/), [Hybrid Pedagogy](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/) 2014+ ([github repo](https://github.com/openmusictheory/openmusictheory.github.io)).

This version is for testing purposes, exploring adapting OER text for the classroom.
It replaces the Jekyll theme with [Ed theme](https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/) ([repo](https://github.com/elotroalex/ed)).

Thanks to everyone who worked on the original!
