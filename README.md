# Open Music Theory OER

This is a fork of Kris Shaffer, Bryn Hughes, and Brian Moseley, *Open Music Theory*, [Hybrid Pedagogy](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/) 2014+.

This version is for test purposes, exploring adapting OER text for the classroom.
It replaces the Jekyll theme with [Ed theme](https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/) ([repo](https://github.com/elotroalex/ed)).

Thanks to everyone who worked on the original!
